abstract = {We are aware that the processing of GPS data through GAMIT processing software is not free from errors. Some of them are generated due to different modules involved in processing. The data quality depends so many factors, like quality of met-instrument, which supplies the meteorological data, algorithm of processing which based on the network homogeneity or heterogeneity and location of the site, whether it is free from multi-path etc. The root mean square errors for New Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Guwahati and Chennai GPS stations are spatially correlated and observations are weighted according to the satellite elevation angle. Diurnal variability of Integrated Precipitable Water Vapour (IPWV) has been shown its range from 45 mm to 65 mm for New Delhi during the monsoon season, 2008.},
